# Backend Setup


**To install dependences run the following:**
`
   npm install
`

**To run the application run the following command**
`
    DEBUG=backend:* npm start
`

**Starter code:**
`npx express-generator .`

`the . (dot) is equivalent to saying drop the files in this directory (no need to create a folder). But, it (dot) can be replaced with api or backend or anything to your choosing`
